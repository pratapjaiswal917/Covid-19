# Covid-19
Project : Analyzing the trends of COVID-19 with Python

# Problem Statement:
Given data about COVID-19 patients, write code to visualize the impact and
analyze the trend of rate of infection and recovery as well as make predictions
about the number of cases expected a week in future based on the current
trends.
# Dataset:
CSV and Excel files containing data about the number of COVID-19 confirmed
deaths and recovered patients both around the world and in India. Download Link
# Guidelines:
● Use pandas to accumulate data from multiple data files.

● Use plotly (visualization library) to create interactive visualizations.

● Use Facebook prophet library to make time series models.

● Visualize the prediction by combining these technologies.
